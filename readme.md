About:
A small script that adds marshallers (and later a docking guidance system object of user's choice) to an X-Plane scenery automatically for every stand, at a user specified distance.

!!! Work in progress, instructions doesn't apply yet and are incomplete.

Instructions:
- Extract the contents of Auto Docking Guidance.zip to the scenery folder where you want to add the marshallers.
- Navigate to that folder. You should see a new folder called adgs and an executable file of the same name.
- Convert that scenery's dsf file to .txt using XGrinder. (This won't be needed in future versions)
- Run the adgs executable. Enter the distance you want the marshaller to be from the stand.
- The scenery's dsf that was converted to .txt is now modified. Convert back to .dsf using XGrinder.
